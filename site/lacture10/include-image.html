            &quot;it is not the critic who counts; not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles, and
            where the doer or deeds could have done them better. The credit belongs to the man who is actually
            in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and seat and blood;
            who strives valiantly; who errs, who comes short again and again,
            because there is no effort without error and shortcoming; but who 
            does actually stirve to do the deeds; who knows great
            enthusiasms, the great devotions; who spends himself in a worthy 
            cause; who at the best knows in the end the truimph of high 
            achievement, and who at the worst, if he fails, at least fails
            while daring greatly, so that his place shall never be with those 
            cold and timid souls who neither know victory nor defeat.&quot;
